## Usability Testing

http://178.128.5.191

This is a school project designed to create a website and database that will allow users to easily create usability tests and send them to people.
User should be able to do the following:

* Submit a link for a page that they want tested
* Submit a number of items they would like completed when they are testing
* Have a URL that will show them feedback on the website

## Codepen links

* [mouse tracking](https://codepen.io/riderjensen/pen/xaRNEy)

## Before Running
* You need to update your package.json in the ENV.ADDR to be reflective of where you are running this (default is localhost :8080)
* You need to change the first line in public/js/taskModal.js to reflect that same address
